\section{Modular forms}



\subsection{Modular forms of level 1}
We will denote by $\halfplane$ the upper half plane.

We say that a complex function $f$ on the upper half plane is weakly modular of weight $2k$ if 
    $f$ is meromorphic on $\halfplane$ and
    $$f(z) = (cz+d)^{-2k} f \left( \frac{az+b}{cz+d} \right) \qquad 
    \forall \begin{pmatrix} a&b\\c&d \end{pmatrix}\in SL_2(\Z).$$

A property of $SL_2(\Z)$ is that when we define 
    $$S = \begin{pmatrix} 0&-1\\1&0 \end{pmatrix} \text{ and }
    T = \begin{pmatrix} 1&1\\0&1 \end{pmatrix},$$
then $SL_2(\Z)$ is generated by $S$ and $T$ \cite[p.1-2]{SL2Z}.


From that property, we can derive an alternative definition of weakly modular functions:
$f$ is weakly modular of weight $2k$ if
    $f$ is meromorphic on $\halfplane$ and
    $f(z+1) = f(z)$ and $f(-1/z) = z^k f(z)$
for all $z \in \Z$.

Moreover, we also define a function 
$f:\halfplane \to \C$ to be modular of weight $2k$ if
    $f$ is holomorphic on $\halfplane$ and
    $f$ is weakly modular.

Lastly, we say that a function 
$f:\halfplane \to \C$ is a modular form of weight $2k$ if
    $f$ is holomorphic at $\infty$ and
    $f$ is modular.

It is easy to check, from definition, that we can add modular forms together, as well as multiply them by a complex:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $f_1(z)+f_2(z)$ is modular of weight $2k$ if $f_1(z)$ and $f_2(z)$ are modular of weight $2k$.
    \item $\lambda f(z)$ is modular of weight $2k$ if $f(z)$ is.
\end{itemize}
Therefore, modular forms of weight $2k$ over $\C$ form a space. We denote it $M_k$.

It is also possible to multiply modular forms, in which case the weights adds on:
If $f_1(z)$ \& $f_2(z)$ are modular of respective weights $2k_1$ \& $2k_2$, then $f_1(z)f_2(z)$ is modular of weight $2k_1+2k_2$ 

We deduce that we can take powers of modular forms, and the weight is then multiplied by the power:
If $f(z)$ is modular of weight $2k$, then $f^n(z)$ is modular of weight $2k*n$ (with $n \in \N$).



\subsection{Typical Modular Forms}
\subsubsection{Eisenstein series $G_k$}
The most famous class of modular forms is probably the Eisenstein series, usually denoted $G_k$. We define them as follows\cite[Examples of Modular Forms of Level 1]{ModularFormsComputationalApproach}:
$$
G_k(z) = \sum_{(m,n) \in \Z^2\setminus\{(0,0)\}} \frac{1}{(mz+n)^{2k}}
$$
for $k \geq 2$.

It is easy to check that $G_k$ are modular of weight $2k$\cite[Proposition 2.1]{ModularFormsComputationalApproach}, as:
$$
G_k(z+1) = G_k(z)
$$
(using $(m,n+m) \to (m,n)$, an invertible map)
$$
G_k(-1/z) = z^k G_k(z)
$$
(using $(m,-n) \to (m,n)$, an invertible map).

It is pleasant to remark that \cite[Proposition 2.2]{ModularFormsComputationalApproach}
$$
G_k(\infty) = \sum_{n \in \Z^*} \frac{1}{n^{2k}} = 2\zeta(2k)
$$.
Where $\zeta(k)$ is Riemann Zeta function.
The values of this function are well known on positive even numbers, and we deduce \cite[p.194]{MathHandbook}:
$$
G_k(\infty) = 2\zeta(2k) = \frac{(2\pi)^{2k}}{(2k)!}B_k
$$
with $B_k = (-1)^{k+1} b_{2k}$ where $b_k$ are Bernoulli's numbers.

\subsubsection{$\varDelta$}
We will be interested in one main modular form in the rest of this article: $\varDelta$.
We define $\varDelta$ in terms of $G_k$ as follows\cite[p.84]{CourseInArithmetic}:
$$
\varDelta = g_2^3 - 27g_3^2 \in M_6^0 \qquad \text{ with } g_2 = 40G_2 \text{ and } g_3 = 140G_3
$$
As $g_2^3$ is modular of weight $4*3=12$ and $g_3^2$ of weight $6*2=12$, $\varDelta$ is modular of weight $12$.

Now, using $G_2(\infty) = 2\zeta(4) = \frac{\pi^4}{45}$ and $G_3(\infty) = 2\zeta(6) = \frac{2\pi^4}{945}$, we get $\varDelta(\infty) = \left( \frac{4\pi^4}{3} \right)^3 - \left( \frac{8\pi^4}{27} \right)^2 =  0$.



\subsection{Cusp Forms}
A function $f:\halfplane \to \C$ that is a modular form may in addition be a cusp form, if $f(\infty)=0$.
We will denote the space of modular cusp forms of weight $2k$ over $\C$ by $M_k^0$.

It is useful to note $G_k(\infty) = \sum_{n \in \N^*} \frac{2}{n^{2k}} > 2$ and in particular, $G_k(\infty) \neq 0$, so $G_k$ are \textit{not} cusp forms for any $k$.
As we have shown it before, $\varDelta(\infty)=0$, so $\varDelta$ is a modular cusp form of weight 12, so $\varDelta \in M_6^0$.
Using tools from complex analysis, we can prove that $\varDelta$ has only one zero (at infinity), which has order one\cite[p.88]{CourseInArithmetic}.
%[proof?]

We have the following relation: 
\begin{theorem}
    $M_k \cong M_k^0 \oplus \C.G_k \qquad \forall k \geq 2$.\cite[p.88]{CourseInArithmetic}
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
    We let $\Phi:M_k \to \C$ such that if $f \in M_k$, $\Phi(f) = f(\infty)$.
    
    Now, we have $\Ker{\Phi} = M_k^0$, therefore, by the 1\textsuperscript{st} Isomorphism Theorem, $\nicefrac{M_k}{M_k^0} \cong \Image{\Phi} \subseteq \C$.
    
    Note that $G_k \in M_k$, and $G_k(\infty) = \sum_{n \in \Z^*} \frac{1}{n^{2k}} \neq 0$, so $G_k \not\in M_k^0$.
    As $G_k \neq 0$, $\dim(\nicefrac{M_k}{M_k^0}) \geq 1$ and $\Image{\Phi} = \C$.
    Thus, $G_k \in M_k\\M_k^0$
    
    Finally, we have $M_k \cong M_k^0 \oplus \C.G_k$ if $k \geq 2$.
    (The above argument fails for $k<2$ as $G_k$ is not well defined any more.)
\end{proof}
Therefore, the dimensions of $M_k$ and $M_k^0$ are closely linked.



\subsection{Dimensions of Spaces of Modular Forms}
The fact that multiplying two modular forms gives a function that remains modular yields that we may map a set of modular forms to an other.

\begin{theorem}
    $M_{k-6} \cong M_k^0$.\cite[p.88]{CourseInArithmetic}
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
    We let $\Phi:M_{k-6} \to M_k^0$ such that if $f \in M_k$, $\Phi(f)(z) = \varDelta(z)f(z)$.
    
    This is well defined as if $f$ has weight $2(k-6)$, $\varDelta.f$ has weight $2k$ since $\varDelta$ has weight $12$. As $\varDelta$ is a cusp from, $\varDelta.f$ will also be a cusp form.
    
    From definition, $\Phi$ is clearly homomorphic.
    
    
    Now, if $g \in M_k^0$, we may define $\Psi: M_k^0 \to M_{k-6}$ such that $\Psi(g)(z) = \nicefrac{g(z)}{\varDelta(z)}$
    
    This is well defined as if $g$ has weight $2k$, $\varDelta.f$ has weight $2k$ since $\varDelta$ has weight $12$. As $\varDelta$ is a cusp from, $\varDelta.f$ will also be a cusp form.
    
    This is well defined as $\varDelta$ has only one zero, at infinity, where $g$ also has a zero (as $g$ is a cusp form). The weights agree again as well.
    
    It is then easy to remark that $\Psi = \Phi^{-1}$. So $\Phi$ is bijective, and thus isomorphic. 
    
    Finally, we have $M_{k-6} \cong M_k^0$.
\end{proof}
This theorem, combined with the previous one is very powerful: it shows that there must be a pattern (of 6) in the sequence of dimensions $\dim(M_k)$ and $\dim(M_k^0)$ for $k \geq 2$.
We have $M_k \cong M_k^0 \oplus \C.G_k \cong M_{k-6} \oplus \C.G_k$, so $\dim(M_k) = \dim(M_{k-6})+1$ when $k \geq 2$.
Thus, if we compute the dimensions of $M_0$, $M_1$, $M_2$, $M_3$, $M_4$, $M_5$, we can extrapolate dimensions of $M_k$ and $M_k^0$ for all $k$.

Using complex analysis techniques again, we have:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $\dim(M_k) = 0 \quad k < 0$
    \item $\dim(M_1) = 0$
    \item $\dim(M_0) = \dim(M_2) = \dim(M_3) = \dim(M_4) = \dim(M_5) = 1$
\end{itemize}
%[proof?]
In the case $k=0$, $\dim(M_0) = 1$. As $f(z) = 1$ is clearly a modular from of weight $0$, $\{1\}$ is a basis for $M_0$. We deduce $\dim(M_k^0) = 0$ as $1$ is clearly not a cusp form.
In the case $k=1$, $\dim(M_1) = 0$, which makes $\dim(M_1^0) = 0$ automatically.
(Cases $k<0$ are similar to $k=1$.)

Other cases may be derived directly from the relations (using induction to get general formulas), and we obtain:

%[Table of dimensions of $M_k$ & $M_k^0$]
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{||c||c|c|c||} 
    \hline
    Space & $k<0$ & $k \geq 0, \ k \equiv 1 \mod 6$ & $k \geq 0, \ k \not \equiv 1 \mod 6$ \\
    \hline
    \hline
    $\dim(M_k)$ & $0$ & $\floor{\nicefrac{k}{6}}$ & $\floor{\nicefrac{k}{6}} + 1$ \\
    \hline
    $\dim(M_k^0)$ & $0$ & $\max\{0, \floor{\nicefrac{k}{6}} - 1\}$ & $\floor{\nicefrac{k}{6}}$ \\
    \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
Note that the $\max$ is taken only to avoid negative dimensions.



\subsection{Fourier Expansion}
\subsubsection{Definition}
To study such function, we use Fourier Expansion.
In the case of $f$ being a modular form of weight $2k$, 
a Fourier Expansion is a representation of $f$ as a power series of $e^{2\pi i n z}$
i.e. $$f(z) = \sum_{n \in \Z} a_n(f) e^{2\pi inz}.$$
We usually denote $q = e^{2\pi i z}$ so that $q^n = e^{2\pi i n z}$ 
and the Fourier expansion of $f$ become 
$$
f(q) = \sum_{n \in \Z} a_n(f) q^n.
$$
When in this form, we may as well call it the $q$ expansion.

\subsubsection{Typical Modular Forms Fourier Expansion}
\paragraph{Fourier Expansions of $G_k$}
The modular forms $G_k$ have the following $q$ expansion\cite[p.92]{CourseInArithmetic}:
$$
G_k(q) = 2\zeta(2k) + 2 \frac{{(2 \pi i)}^{2k}}{(2k-1)!} \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \sigma_{2k-1}(n)q^n
$$
with $\sigma_{s}(n) = \sum_{d | n} d^s$, for $k \geq 4$.
%[proof?]

\paragraph{Fourier Expansion of $\varDelta$}
We also have\cite[p.95]{CourseInArithmetic}:
$$
\varDelta(q) = (2\pi)^{12} q \prod_{n=1}^{\infty} (1-q^n)^{24}
$$
%[Proof?]



\subsection{A Basis for Modular Forms}
\label{BasisModularForms}
The set of modular forms that are weight $2k$ in fact form a vector space (we can add modular forms together, and multiply them with a constant) over the complex numbers. 
One may ask then a basis for this vector space.

We would like to find a basis for each set $M_k$. It turns out that the modular forms $G_2$ and $G_3$ introduced before in fact generate a basis for all $M_k$. 
It is not obvious and may in fact seems wrong at a first stage: $G_2$ and $G_3$ are modular forms of weight $4$ and $6$, whereas $M_k$ in general have modular forms of weight $2k$.
However, by taking combinations of $G_2$ and $G_3$, we may obtain modular forms of any weight $2k$. It is important to remember that when multiplied, the weight of modular forms add up.

\begin{theorem}
    The set $S = \{G_2^aG_3^b | a,b \in \N, 2a+3b = k\}$\footnote{The set of naturals $\N$ is taken to start from $0$.} is a basis for $M_k$.\cite[Theorem 2.17]{ModularFormsComputationalApproach}
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
    Of course, the cases when $\dim(M_k)=0$ (for $k<0$ and $k=1$) are trivial, as the basis is empty, and $2a+3b = k$ has no solution for $a,b \in \N$.
    
    To show $S$ is a basis, we need it to span $M_k$ and to be linearly independent.
    
    We start with spanning, and we proceed by induction on $k$, with step $6$.
    
    As $\dim(M_k)=1$ for $k=0,2,3,4,5,7$, and the equation $2a+3b = k$ has exactly one solution for $a,b \in \N$ (namely $(a,b)=(0,0), (1,0), (0,1), (2,0), (1,1), (2,1)$), $S$ has only one element, which must be the basis.
    
    Now, for $k>7$, take some $a,b \in \N$ such that $2a+3b=k$. Let $f \in M_k$, and $g = G_2^aG_3^b \in M_k$.
    $g(\infty) \neq 0$ as none of $G_2$ or $G_3$ is a cusp form. 
    So there must be a complex $\lambda$ such that $f - \lambda g$ is a cusp form. 
    Then $f - \lambda g \in M_k \cong M_{k-6}^0$ and we can find a $h \in M_{k-6}^*$ such that $h.\varDelta=f - \lambda g$.
    
    By induction, $h$ must be a polynomial of $G_2$ and $G_3$; by definition, $\varDelta$ is one as well (note that yet, we don't put any restriction on powers of $G_2$ and $G_3$, other then being positive integers).
    Therefore, $f = \varDelta.h + \lambda g$ is a polynomial of $G_2$ and $G_3$.
    From the fact that $f \in M_k$ (i.e. $f$ has weight $2k$), terms of $f$ as a polynomial of $G_2$ and $G_3$ have the from $G_2^aG_3^b$ with $2a+3b=k$.
    
    We now want to show linear independence, we proceed by contradiction.
    
    Suppose there is a non-trivial linear relation of terms $G_2^aG_3^b$. 
    We can multiply it by suitable $G_2$ and $G_3$ so that all terms have the form $2a+3b = k \equiv 0 \mod 12$.
    Then, we can divide all terms by $G_3^2$, witch gives us that there is a polynomial for which $\nicefrac{G_2^3}{G_3^2}$ is a root.
    In particular, this polynomial is constant when $\nicefrac{G_2^3}{G_3^2}$ is plugged.
    This contradicts the fact that $q$ expansion of $\nicefrac{G_2^3}{G_3^2}$ is not constant.
\end{proof}

This set of makes to be a basis, and one may even find it pleasant: given the two modular forms $G_2$ and $G_3$, this set generates all the modular forms of weight $2k$ that we could think of, if we only knew these two modular forms.



\subsection{Hecke Operators}
\label{DefHeckeOperators}
We define the Hecke operators for a modular form $f$ as follows\cite[p.100]{CourseInArithmetic}:
$$
T(n)f(z) = n^{2k-1}\sum_{a \geq 1,\, ad=n,\, 0 \leq b < d} d^{-2k}f \left( \frac{az+b}{d} \right)
$$
with $n \in \N$.

We can check that $T(n)f$ is modular if $f$ is (as the sum of modular forms).

%[properties of T(n)? (T(mn) and T(p)T(p^n))]

We may as well write $T(n)f$ as a Fourier Expansion of $q=e^{2 \pi i z}$ as follows\cite[p.100]{CourseInArithmetic}:
$$
T(n)f(z) = \sum_{m \in \Z} \gamma(m)q^m
\quad \text{ with } \quad 
\gamma(z) = \sum_{a | (n,m),\, a \geq 1} a^{2k-1} c\left( \frac{mn}{a^2} \right)
$$
$$
\text{For modular forms } f \text{ s.t. }
f(z) = \sum_{n \in \Z} \alpha(n)q^n
$$
